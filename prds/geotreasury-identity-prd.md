# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GeoTreasury Identity

## 1. Overview

**GeoTreasury Identity** is the identity verification layer for the GeoTreasury.com platform, responsible for decentralized identity (DID) management and eligibility checks using Atala PRISM. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success criteria for the development of the identity system, as derived from the project roadmap.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

- **Purpose:**
  - To provide secure, privacy-preserving, and compliant identity verification for recipients and merchants using Atala PRISM.
- **Scope:**
  - DID creation and management
  - Credential issuance and verification
  - Country-specific eligibility checks
  - Consent management for data sharing
  - Integration hooks for other platform components (core, API, frontend)

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1 DID Management
- Creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for users
- Secure storage and retrieval of DIDs
- User interface hooks for onboarding and wallet association

### 3.2 Credential Verification
- Issuance and verification of credentials (e.g., residency, age, compliance)
- Support for country-specific eligibility requirements
- Privacy-preserving verification workflows

### 3.3 Consent & Privacy Management
- Granular consent options for data sharing
- User control over credential sharing and verification
- Compliance with global privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)

### 3.4 Integration & Compliance
- Integration hooks for onboarding, UBI eligibility, and compliance checks
- Modular compliance logic for different jurisdictions
- Automated compliance reporting mechanisms

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Protection of user identity and credential data
  - Secure authentication and authorization
- **Privacy:**
  - Privacy-preserving verification and consent management
  - Minimal data exposure during verification
- **Performance:**
  - Fast credential issuance and verification
  - Scalable to support global user base
- **Usability:**
  - Intuitive onboarding and consent flows
  - Multilingual and accessible design

## 5. Success Criteria

- Users can create and manage DIDs securely
- Credentials are issued and verified accurately
- Country-specific eligibility checks function as intended
- Consent management allows granular permissions
- System complies with relevant privacy and regulatory standards

## 6. Milestones & Timeline

- **Phase 1:**
  - DID creation and management
  - Credential issuance and verification
  - Consent management implementation
- **Phase 2:**
  - Country-specific eligibility and compliance modules
  - Integration with onboarding and UBI eligibility flows
  - Automated compliance reporting

## 7. Out of Scope

- Backend smart contract logic (handled in core repository)
- Full Atala PRISM implementation (integration and configuration only)
- Frontend user interfaces (handled in frontend repository)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Regulatory changes:** Addressed by modular compliance logic and regular updates.
- **User privacy concerns:** Mitigated by privacy-preserving verification and granular consent.
- **Integration complexity:** Minimized by providing clear integration hooks and documentation.

## 9. Glossary
