# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GeoTreasury Notifications

## 1. Overview

**GeoTreasury Notifications** is the notification delivery layer for the GeoTreasury.com platform, responsible for providing a multi-channel notification system for recipients, including email, Atala PRISM secure messaging, and on-chain notifications. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success criteria for the development of the notification system, as derived from the project roadmap.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

- **Purpose:**
  - To ensure timely, secure, and reliable delivery of notifications to UBI recipients and platform users through multiple channels.
- **Scope:**
  - Email notification service
  - Atala PRISM secure messaging integration
  - On-chain notification mechanism (transaction metadata)
  - Notification delivery confirmation and read receipts
  - Notification preferences management
  - Integration hooks for platform components (core, frontend, API)

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Multi-Channel Notification Delivery
- Support for email notifications with encryption
- Integration with Atala PRISM for secure, decentralized messaging
- On-chain notifications using transaction metadata
- Configurable notification channels per user

### 3.2 Delivery Confirmation & Read Receipts
- Mechanisms for confirming delivery and receipt of notifications
- Real-time status updates for notification delivery
- Logging and reporting of notification events

### 3.3 Notification Preferences Management
- User interface hooks for managing notification preferences
- Opt-in/opt-out controls for each channel
- Support for multi-language notifications

### 3.4 Integration & Automation
- APIs for triggering notifications from smart contracts and platform events
- Automated notification workflows for UBI distributions and important updates
- Hooks for onboarding, transparency reporting, and governance events

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Secure delivery of sensitive notifications
  - Protection of user data and privacy
- **Reliability:**
  - High delivery rate and low latency
  - Graceful handling of delivery failures and retries
- **Usability:**
  - Intuitive management of notification preferences
  - Multi-language and accessible design
- **Scalability:**
  - Support for growing user base and notification volume

## 5. Success Criteria

- Notification delivery rate above 99%
- Average notification delivery time under 1 minute
- User opt-in rate for notifications above 90%
- Notification read rate above 80%
- All critical notifications delivered reliably across channels

## 6. Milestones & Timeline

- **Phase 1:**
  - Email and Atala PRISM notification integration
  - On-chain notification mechanism
  - Delivery confirmation and read receipt implementation
- **Phase 2:**
  - Notification preferences management
  - Multi-language support and accessibility enhancements
  - Advanced automation and integration with platform events

## 7. Out of Scope

- Backend smart contract logic (handled in core repository)
- Full Atala PRISM implementation (integration only)
- Frontend user interfaces (handled in frontend repository)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Delivery failures:** Mitigated by retry logic and multi-channel redundancy.
- **User privacy concerns:** Addressed by secure delivery and opt-in controls.
- **Integration complexity:** Minimized by providing clear APIs and documentation.

## 9. Glossary
- **Atala PRISM:** Decentralized identity and messaging solution for Cardano.
- **On-chain Notification:** Notification delivered via blockchain transaction metadata.
