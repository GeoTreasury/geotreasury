# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GeoTreasury Randomness

## 1. Overview

**GeoTreasury Randomness** is the randomness and oracle integration layer for the GeoTreasury.com platform, responsible for integrating with the Charli3 Oracle to provide verifiable randomness for UBI recipient selection. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success criteria for the development of the randomness system, as derived from the project roadmap.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

- **Purpose:**
  - To ensure fair, transparent, and auditable random selection of UBI recipients using decentralized oracle technology.
- **Scope:**
  - Integration with Charli3 Oracle for random number generation
  - Verifiable randomness for recipient selection
  - Audit trails and transparency mechanisms
  - Failure handling and fallback logic
  - Integration hooks for smart contracts and platform components

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Charli3 Oracle Integration
- Secure connection to Charli3 Oracle for random number requests
- Support for scheduled and on-demand randomness generation
- Handling of oracle responses and error conditions

### 3.2 Verifiable Randomness
- Use of oracle-provided randomness for UBI recipient selection
- Publicly auditable randomness process
- Storage of randomness proofs and audit data

### 3.3 Audit & Transparency
- Creation of audit trails for all randomness events
- Integration with transparency reporting tools
- Mechanisms for independent verification of randomness

### 3.4 Failure Handling
- Fallback logic for oracle failures or delays
- Monitoring and alerting for randomness generation issues
- Cost optimization for oracle usage

### 3.5 Integration Hooks
- APIs and interfaces for smart contracts to request and consume randomness
- Hooks for recipient selection and distribution logic

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Secure communication with Charli3 Oracle
  - Protection against manipulation or replay attacks
- **Reliability:**
  - High availability and timely randomness delivery
  - Graceful handling of oracle failures
- **Transparency:**
  - All randomness events are publicly auditable
  - Comprehensive logging and reporting
- **Performance:**
  - Efficient handling of randomness requests and responses
  - Scalable to support global recipient base

## 5. Success Criteria

- Random numbers are generated verifiably and securely for all UBI distributions
- Audit trails provide full transparency for recipient selection
- System handles oracle failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- All randomness events are independently verifiable

## 6. Milestones & Timeline

- **Phase 1:**
  - Charli3 Oracle integration and random number request logic
  - Verifiable randomness storage and audit trail creation
- **Phase 2:**
  - Integration with smart contracts and recipient selection logic
  - Transparency reporting and monitoring tools
  - Fallback and failure handling enhancements

## 7. Out of Scope

- Smart contract development (handled in core repository)
- Frontend user interfaces (handled in frontend repository)
- Full oracle implementation (integration only)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Oracle downtime or failure:** Mitigated by fallback logic and monitoring.
- **Randomness manipulation:** Addressed by using verifiable, decentralized oracle and audit trails.
- **Integration complexity:** Minimized by providing clear APIs and documentation.

## 9. Glossary
- **Charli3:** Decentralized oracle for Cardano.
- **Oracle:** Service providing external data (randomness) to smart contracts.
- **Verifiable Randomness:** Random numbers with proofs that can be independently audited.
