# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GeoTreasury API

## 1. Overview

**GeoTreasury API** is the e-commerce API layer for the GeoTreasury.com platform, responsible for ADA payment processing, merchant integration, and automatic UBI allocation. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success criteria for the development of the API system, as derived from the project roadmap.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

- **Purpose:**
  - To provide a secure, scalable, and easy-to-integrate API for merchants to process ADA payments and automatically allocate a percentage to the UBI treasury.
- **Scope:**
  - RESTful API endpoints for payment processing
  - SDKs for merchant integration (JavaScript, Python, PHP)
  - Multi-output transaction handling for UBI allocation
  - Transaction monitoring and reporting
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication and security

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Payment Processing
- Stripe-like API for ADA payments
- Support for single and batched transactions
- Automatic allocation of 2-10% of each transaction to the UBI treasury
- Configurable UBI allocation percentage per merchant
- Real-time transaction status updates (WebSocket support)

### 3.2 Merchant Integration
- SDKs for popular e-commerce platforms (WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.)
- Easy onboarding and API key management
- Merchant dashboard integration hooks
- Customization options for UBI allocation and reporting

### 3.3 UBI Allocation
- Multi-output transaction support using Cardano's eUTXO model
- Integration with core smart contracts for treasury management
- Transparent and auditable allocation logic

### 3.4 Monitoring & Reporting
- Transaction monitoring and analytics endpoints
- Automated reporting for merchants and platform administrators
- Integration with transparency reporting tools

### 3.5 Security & Compliance
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for all endpoints
- Rate limiting and fraud detection
- Compliance hooks for KYC/AML (via Atala PRISM integration)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Secure API authentication and authorization
  - Protection of sensitive merchant and transaction data
- **Performance:**
  - API response time under 500ms for 99% of requests
  - High availability and scalability
- **Reliability:**
  - 99.9% uptime
  - Graceful error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Usability:**
  - Comprehensive documentation and SDKs
  - Simple integration process for merchants

## 5. Success Criteria

- API successfully processes test and live ADA transactions with correct UBI allocation
- SDK integration time under 1 hour for technical users
- Transaction success rate above 99.9%
- Merchant retention rate above 85% after 6 months
- All endpoints pass security and performance tests

## 6. Milestones & Timeline

- **Phase 1:**
  - Core payment processing API and SDKs
  - UBI allocation logic and integration
  - Transaction monitoring and reporting endpoints
- **Phase 2:**
  - Advanced merchant dashboard integration
  - Real-time updates and analytics
  - Compliance and fraud detection enhancements

## 7. Out of Scope

- Smart contract development (handled in core repository)
- Frontend user interfaces (handled in frontend repository)
- Full KYC/AML implementation (integration hooks only)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Integration complexity:** Minimized by providing SDKs and comprehensive documentation.
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Mitigated by OAuth 2.0, rate limiting, and regular audits.
- **Regulatory changes:** Addressed by modular compliance hooks and regular updates.

## 9. Glossary
- **ADA:** Native cryptocurrency of Cardano.
- **eUTXO:** Extended Unspent Transaction Output model.
- **UBI:** Universal Basic Income.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Industry-standard authentication protocol.
- **SDK:** Software Development Kit.
