# Product Requirements Document (PRD): GeoTreasury Scalability

## 1. Overview

**GeoTreasury Scalability** is the scalability and performance layer for the GeoTreasury.com platform, responsible for implementing solutions such as Hydra Heads for off-chain transaction processing. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success criteria for the development of the scalability system, as derived from the project roadmap.

## 2. Purpose & Scope

- **Purpose:**
  - To enable the GeoTreasury platform to handle increased transaction volumes and user base efficiently and cost-effectively through advanced scalability solutions.
- **Scope:**
  - Integration of Hydra Heads for off-chain processing
  - State channel development for transaction batching
  - Settlement protocols for main chain recording
  - Monitoring, fallback, and optimization mechanisms
  - Research and integration of alternative Layer-2 solutions

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Hydra Heads Integration
- Implementation of Hydra Head infrastructure for off-chain transaction processing
- Support for opening, operating, and closing Hydra Heads
- Efficient batching and settlement of transactions to the Cardano main chain

### 3.2 State Channels & Batching
- Development of state channels for grouping multiple transactions
- Protocols for secure and atomic batch settlement
- Handling of edge cases and dispute resolution

### 3.3 Settlement Protocols
- Mechanisms for periodic settlement of off-chain transactions to the main chain
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity during settlement
- Fallback mechanisms for failed settlements

### 3.4 Monitoring & Optimization
- Real-time monitoring of off-chain and on-chain activity
- Performance analytics and anomaly detection
- Cost optimization for transaction processing
- Fallback mechanisms for Hydra or Layer-2 failures

### 3.5 Alternative Layer-2 Research
- Evaluation and prototyping of alternative Layer-2 solutions as backup
- Circuit breakers and contingency planning for scalability failures

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**
  - Secure operation of Hydra Heads and state channels
  - Protection against double-spending and fraud
- **Performance:**
  - High throughput and low latency for off-chain transactions
  - Scalable to support global user base
- **Reliability:**
  - Graceful degradation and fallback to on-chain processing if needed
  - Robust error handling and recovery
- **Transparency:**
  - Auditable settlement and transaction records
  - Comprehensive monitoring and reporting

## 5. Success Criteria

- System successfully processes transactions off-chain and settles to the main chain
- Hydra Heads operate securely and efficiently under load
- Fallback mechanisms activate appropriately during failures
- Performance and cost metrics meet or exceed targets

## 6. Milestones & Timeline

- **Phase 1:**
  - Hydra Head infrastructure setup and initial integration
  - State channel and batching protocol development
  - Basic monitoring and reporting tools
- **Phase 2:**
  - Advanced settlement protocols and fallback mechanisms
  - Performance optimization and anomaly detection
  - Research and prototyping of alternative Layer-2 solutions

## 7. Out of Scope

- Smart contract development (handled in core repository)
- Frontend user interfaces (handled in frontend repository)
- Full Layer-2 protocol development (integration and configuration only)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

- **Hydra or Layer-2 failures:** Mitigated by fallback mechanisms and contingency planning.
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Addressed by regular audits and robust protocol design.
- **Integration complexity:** Minimized by modular architecture and clear documentation.

## 9. Glossary
- **Hydra Heads:** Cardano Layer-2 solution for off-chain processing.
- **State Channel:** Off-chain mechanism for batching transactions.
- **Settlement:** Recording of off-chain transactions on the main blockchain.
- **Layer-2:** Scalability solution operating on top of the base blockchain.
