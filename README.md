# GeoTreasury

Welcome to GeoTreasury, a pioneering Cardano-based e-commerce platform designed to address automation-driven economic displacement through a novel Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution system. By automatically allocating 2-10% of e-commerce transactions to a UBI treasury, GeoTreasury creates a sustainable funding mechanism that distributes resources to randomly selected verified individuals. Our mission is to build an economic safety net that grows with digital commerce, ensuring the benefits of automation are shared equitably across society.

This repository serves as the central hub for the GeoTreasury project, housing high-level assets such as research, the project roadmap, and a static webpage outlining our mission and community links. It acts as the entry point for contributors, developers, and stakeholders to explore the project and navigate to specialized repositories.

## About GeoTreasury

GeoTreasury leverages Cardano‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure, Atala PRISM for identity verification, Charli3 Oracle for randomness, and Hydra for scalability to create a transparent, fair, and efficient UBI distribution system. Key features include:

- **E-commerce Integration**: A Stripe-like API for ADA payments with automatic UBI allocation.
- **Fair Distribution**: Verifiable randomness for recipient selection via Charli3 Oracle.
- **Identity Verification**: Privacy-preserving decentralized identity management with Atala PRISM.
- **Scalability**: Hydra Heads for off-chain processing to handle global transaction volumes.
- **Transparency**: Open-source code and automated reporting for public verification.
