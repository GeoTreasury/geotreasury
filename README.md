# Summary
# Cardano UBI E-commerce Platform

🌍 **A Stripe-like e-commerce platform on Cardano with Universal Basic Income (UBI) to combat automation’s societal despair.** This open-source project aims to share 5-10% of transaction profits with random Cardano users, fostering equity and opportunity. Developers can restrict UBI to specific countries, supporting local or global impact. We’re seeking collaborators to build this vision!

## Purpose
Automation displaces workers and fuels inequality. This platform redistributes e-commerce profits as UBI to *any* Cardano user, not just app users, providing a safety net for displaced workers to retrain, start businesses, or thrive.

## Why It’s Needed
Tech is cutting jobs in retail, logistics, and beyond. Software engineers, while part of this challenge, can drive solutions by building systems that share wealth. This project empowers engineers to create a fairer future.

## How It Works
- **E-commerce API**: Developers integrate ADA payments via a Stripe-like API.
- **UBI Treasury**: 5-10% of profits feed a Plutus smart contract treasury.
- **Random Distribution**: Cardano’s RNG selects recipients from Atala PRISM’s identity registry.
- **Country Restrictions**: Developers can limit UBI to specific countries (e.g., US, IN) using Atala PRISM credentials.
- **Notifications**: Recipients get ADA + a message: “someapp.com shared 5 ADA with you.”
- **Global or Local**: Benefits all Cardano users or targeted regions, as chosen by developers.

## Feasibility
- **Cardano’s Tech**: Low fees, Hydra scaling, Plutus contracts, and Atala PRISM ensure secure, scalable UBI.
- **Prototyping**: Build and test on Cardano’s testnets using Plutus Playground and Developer Portal.
- **Incentives**: Contributors can pursue Project Catalyst funding and earn NFTs.
