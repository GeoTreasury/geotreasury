### Detailed Analysis of Native Cardano Oracle Projects and Implementation of Charli3

This comprehensive analysis explores native Cardano projects that provide decentralized oracle services similar to Chainlink, focusing on their functionality, maturity, and relevance to the Cardano UBI E-commerce Platform described on [geotreasury.com]([invalid url, do not cite]). It then provides a detailed explanation of how the top contender, Charli3, can be implemented to support the platform’s need for random recipient selection for Universal Basic Income (UBI) distributions. The analysis draws on web search results and inferred details as of 1:52 PM CDT on Wednesday, May 21, 2025.

#### Background on the Cardano UBI E-commerce Platform
The Cardano UBI E-commerce Platform, pitched by Micheal Giles on X, aims to create a decentralized e-commerce system on the Cardano blockchain, redistributing 2-10% of transaction profits as UBI to random Cardano users. The platform provides a Stripe-like API for ADA payments, supporting one-off purchases and subscriptions, similar to Square’s functionality. A Plutus smart contract manages the UBI treasury, collecting profits and distributing them to recipients selected randomly from the Atala PRISM identity registry, with optional country restrictions. The project is open-source, licensed under MIT, and relies on community funding through [Project Catalyst]([invalid url, do not cite]), avoiding profit-taking for operations.

The platform requires a reliable source of randomness to ensure fair and varied recipient selection for UBI distributions. Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a well-known solution for providing tamper-proof randomness, but the user seeks native Cardano alternatives. This analysis identifies these alternatives and details how the top contender, Charli3, can be implemented.

#### Top Contender: Charli3
**Charli3** is the most developed and relevant native Cardano oracle project, offering decentralized, secure, and scalable data solutions tailored to Cardano’s eUTXO model. Its use of a Substrate-based sidechain, active community support, and existing data feeds (e.g., ADA/USD) make it the top choice for your UBI platform, particularly for generating random numbers to select recipients.

#### Implementation of Charli3 for the UBI Platform
Charli3 can be integrated into your Cardano UBI E-commerce Platform to provide verifiable randomness for selecting UBI recipients, ensuring fairness and variability in each distribution cycle. Below is a detailed explanation of how this can be implemented, focusing on randomness for recipient selection.

##### **Charli3’s Architecture**
- **Decentralized Node Network**: Charli3 operates a network of node operators who fetch and validate data from multiple sources, ensuring no single point of failure [Charli3 Official Website](https://charli3.io/). For randomness, these operators can generate random numbers using cryptographic methods.
- **Substrate Sidechain**: Charli3 is developing a sidechain using Substrate to achieve sub-second data retrieval, bypassing Cardano’s 20-second block time [AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/how-charli3-is-transforming-cardano-with-its-substrate-based-side-chain-oracle/). This sidechain handles data processing and relays results to Cardano smart contracts.
- **$C3 Token**: Used for transaction fees and incentivizing node operators, ensuring a sustainable economic model.
- **Push and Pull Oracles**: Charli3 offers pull oracles for on-demand data (e.g., randomness for a specific distribution) and push oracles for continuous updates, suitable for real-time needs [Charli3 FAQ](https://charli3.io/faq).
- **Integration Tools**: Provides SDKs, code samples, and documentation for seamless integration with Plutus smart contracts [Charli3 GitHub](https://github.com/Charli3-Official).

##### **Implementation Steps**
To implement Charli3 for random recipient selection in your UBI platform, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Recipient Pool**:
   - Use Atala PRISM to create a pool of eligible Cardano users, each with a decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials (e.g., country of residence).
   - Filter the pool based on configured country restrictions (e.g., US, India), as set during smart contract deployment.

2. **Request Randomness from Charli3**:
   - The Plutus smart contract initiates a request to Charli3’s oracle network for a random number when a UBI distribution is triggered (e.g., monthly or when the treasury reaches a threshold).
   - The request is sent via a transaction to Charli3’s oracle address, specifying the need for randomness.

3. **Generate and Validate Randomness**:
   - Charli3’s node operators generate a random number using cryptographic methods, potentially on the Substrate sidechain for efficiency.
   - The operators validate the number through a consensus mechanism to ensure it’s unbiased and tamper-proof.
   - A cryptographic proof is generated to accompany the random number, ensuring verifiability.

4. **Relay Randomness to the Smart Contract**:
   - Charli3 submits the random number and proof to the Cardano blockchain via a transaction, which the UBI smart contract consumes.
   - The smart contract verifies the proof to confirm the randomness is legitimate.

5. **Select Recipients**:
   - The verified random number is used as a seed to select a subset of recipients from the Atala PRISM pool.
   - For example, if the pool has 10,000 users and 100 recipients are needed, the random number generates indices to pick unique users, ensuring each has an equal chance.

6. **Distribute UBI**:
   - The smart contract transfers ADA to the selected recipients’ wallet addresses, as identified in the Atala PRISM registry.
   - The transaction is recorded on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring transparency.

7. **Ensure Variability**:
   - Each Charli3 request generates a new, unpredictable random number, ensuring that each distribution cycle selects a different list of recipients.
   - The cryptographic proof prevents manipulation, maintaining fairness.

##### **Technical Example**
Below is a pseudocode example of how the UBI smart contract might integrate with Charli3 for randomness, ensuring different recipient lists for each distribution.


-- Plutus Smart Contract for UBI Distribution

-- Data Types
data Config = Config
  { ubiPercentage :: Integer -- Percentage of transaction for UBI (2-10%)
  , allowedCountries :: [Text] -- List of allowed countries
  }

data TreasuryState = TreasuryState
  { balance :: Integer -- Current ADA balance in treasury
  , lastDistribution :: POSIXTime -- Timestamp of last distribution
  }

data Redeemer = DistributeUBI
  { charli3Random :: Integer -- Random number from Charli3
  , charli3Proof :: ByteString -- Cryptographic proof of randomness
  }

-- Validator Logic
validator :: Config -> TreasuryState -> Redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool
validator config state redeemer ctx = case redeemer of
  DistributeUBI charli3Random charli3Proof ->
    -- Verify Charli3's randomness proof
    verifyCharli3Proof charli3Proof charli3Random &&
    -- Check if distribution is due (e.g., monthly)
    isDistributionDue state.lastDistribution (txInfoValidRange ctx) &&
    -- Select recipients using random number
    let recipients = selectRecipients charli3Random (allowedCountries config)
    in
      -- Ensure funds are distributed to valid recipients
      all (isValidRecipient config) recipients &&
      -- Ensure correct amount is distributed
      sum (map ubiAmount recipients) <= state.balance &&
      -- Update treasury state
      updateTreasuryState state recipients

-- Helper Functions
verifyCharli3Proof :: ByteString -> Integer -> Bool
verifyCharli3Proof proof random = -- Verify cryptographic proof (implementation depends on Charli3)

selectRecipients :: Integer -> [Text] -> [Address]
selectRecipients random countries =
  -- Use random number as seed to select from Atala PRISM registry
  let eligible = filterByCountry countries atalaPrismRegistry
      indices = generateIndices random (length eligible)
  in map (getAddress eligible) indices

isValidRecipient :: Config -> Address -> Bool
isValidRecipient config addr = -- Verify recipient is in Atala PRISM and matches country restrictions

updateTreasuryState :: TreasuryState -> [Address] -> TreasuryState
updateTreasuryState state recipients = -- Update balance and last distribution time


##### **Ensuring Different Recipient Lists**
- **Randomness Variability**: Charli3’s random number generation ensures each request produces a unique number, leading to different recipient lists for each distribution cycle.
- **Cryptographic Proof**: The proof accompanying the random number allows verification, ensuring no manipulation occurs, which guarantees fairness.
