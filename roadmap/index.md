# GeoTreasury.com Roadmap

## 1. Executive Summary

GeoTreasury.com is a pioneering Cardano-based e-commerce platform designed to address automation-driven economic displacement through a novel Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution system. By automatically allocating 2-10% of e-commerce transactions to a UBI treasury, GeoTreasury creates a sustainable funding mechanism that distributes resources to randomly selected verified individuals. The platform leverages Cardano's blockchain infrastructure, Atala PRISM for identity verification, Charli3 Oracle for randomness, and Hydra for scalability to create a transparent, fair, and efficient UBI distribution system that can scale globally.

Our mission is to create an economic safety net that grows proportionally with digital commerce, ensuring that as automation increases productivity, the benefits are shared more equitably across society.

## 2. Research Synthesis

Key findings from our research that inform this roadmap:

- **E-commerce Integration**: A Stripe-like API for ADA payments can seamlessly integrate with merchant platforms while automatically allocating a percentage to UBI.
- **Identity Verification**: Atala PRISM provides the necessary infrastructure for decentralized identity verification while preserving user privacy.
- **Fair Distribution**: Charli3 Oracle can provide verifiable randomness for recipient selection, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Scalability Solutions**: Hydra Heads enable off-chain processing for high transaction volumes without congesting the main Cardano blockchain.
- **Smart Contract Architecture**: A dual-contract approach with a primary treasury contract and a side contract for recipient management optimizes for efficiency and fairness.
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Country-specific eligibility verification and configurable parameters allow for compliance with varying regulatory requirements.
- **Transparency Requirements**: Open-source code, public verification of transactions, and regular reporting are essential for building trust.
